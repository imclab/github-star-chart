Playing around with GitHub API, bar graph of a users starred repos
===================================================================

Wanted to make something funky with [GitHub API](http://developer.github.com/v3/) and `canvas` that shows the repos a user has starred. Disclaimer - this demo is not funky. Just playing around really so next one will actually be interesting.

Also not coded very well so there's a good chance if you can't see anything it's coz the API call limit is exceeded, or the user you searched for doesn't exist. Or some other reason which is my fault.
